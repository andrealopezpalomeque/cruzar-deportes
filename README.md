## Deploying the Storefront After Back-Office Changes

When you finish curating products in the back office, run the helper script to rebuild and deploy the customer-facing site:

```bash
shared/scripts/deploy-home.sh
```

This script installs dependencies for the `home/` app, runs `npm run firebase:build`, and then `npm run firebase:deploy`. Ensure you are authenticated with the Firebase CLI before running it.
