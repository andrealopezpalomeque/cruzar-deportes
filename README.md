cd home/
npm install
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build

```

## Scraper Tool

Image collection tool for building product catalogs from sports merchandise sources.

```bash
cd scraper/
yarn install
node src/scraper.js --help    # Show commands
node src/scraper.js --list    # Available categories
```

## Quick Start

1. **Development:** `cd home && npm run dev`
2. **Image Collection:** `cd scraper && node src/scraper.js --help`
3. **Deploy:** `cd home && npm run firebase:build-deploy`


## Environment Configuration

Shared scripts and the back-office API read the Firebase credentials from a repository level `.env` file. To set this up:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root.
2. Fill in the absolute path to your Firebase service-account JSON, the project ID, and the storage bucket name.
3. Whenever you run `shared/scripts/deploy-home.sh` (or any node script that imports `shared/utils/productSync.ts`), the script automatically sources `.env` and `.env.local` if they exist.

The service account must have permission to read and write `shared/products.json` in the configured Cloud Storage bucket; otherwise the sync will silently fall back to the local JSON copy.


## Deploying the Storefront After Back-Office Changes

When you finish curating products in the back office, run the helper script to rebuild and deploy the customer-facing site:

```bash
shared/scripts/deploy-home.sh
```

This script installs dependencies for the `home/` app, runs `npm run firebase:build`, and then `npm run firebase:deploy`. Ensure you are authenticated with the Firebase CLI before running it.
